## Mornington/Roslyn
The Mornington/Roslyn Lawn Tennis Club, established in 1938, is a family-oriented club which aims to promote tennis and provide a friendly, relaxed environment with an emphasis on fun. Our objective is to actively engage the community and promote tennis at both social and competitive levels. We have on board a New Zealand/internationally qualified coach, who has helped build a strong, competitive junior section and assists with the Hot Shots programme (designed for primary-school-aged children keen to learn the basics of tennis). We cater for junior and senior players who wish to participate in competitions offered by Tennis Otago, as well as social players of all ages and abilities.  We value a sense of fair play, sportsmanship and competitiveness in an environment that encourages development and growth as well as fun and social interaction.

The club has three hard courts which were recently resurfaced, and plan for a fourth (subject to funds).  The ultimate aim is to have all four courts surfaced with Plexipave, an international hard court surface. We also offer our members use of a ball machine and key to the gate which provides access all year round.

We offer various types of membership at very reasonable fees.  Membership options include: senior competitive or social; junior competitive, junior social and family concessions.  Financial members can participate in the regular club events which include:

Social tennis from 6-8pm on Mondays and Wednesdays in the summer, and Saturday afternoons from 1-3pm. During winter Saturday afternoon sessions open to all comers.
