## Terms of Use

This page sets out the card’s terms of use. It also details the general business discount conditions and what you can do if you experience any problems using your Tennis Otago Club Card at a Card Business.

Your Tennis Otago Club Card is a personal card.  This means you:

must present this card to get any of its discounts and concessions
cannot give your card away, lend or offer it
cannot use your card if we have asked you to send it back and/or have sent you a new card.
General discount terms

The Tennis Otago Club Card business discounts apply to Tennis Otago Club Cardholders only. They do not apply to family members or friends.

Unless otherwise stated, the Tennis Otago Club Card discount cannot be used in conjunction with any other offer. Make sure you ask the business offering the discount whether there are any such conditions before making a purchase.

Always ask what the normal quoted price is before asking for the Tennis Otago Club Card discount or presenting your card. This will help ensure you receive your full discount.

Present your Tennis Otago Club Card at the time of booking or prior to making your purchase. Some businesses may find it difficult to process a discount once a transaction has been completed.

Complaints and feedback

If you have concerns with the quality of goods or services you have received, you will need to take these up with the retailer or supplier.

Organisations such as the Consumers’ Institute, the Ministry of Consumer Affairs or Citizens Advice Bureau may assist with further advice.
