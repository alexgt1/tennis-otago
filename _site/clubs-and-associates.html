Our objective is to actively engage the community and promote tennis at both social and competitive levels.

We cater for junior and senior players who wish to participate in competitions offered by Tennis Otago, as well as social players of all ages and abilities.  We value a sense of fair play, sportsmanship and competitiveness in an environment that encourages development and growth as well as fun and social interaction.</p>

The ultimate aim is to have all four courts surfaced with Plexipave, an international hard court surface. We also offer our members use of a ball machine and key to the gate which provides access all year round.</p>
