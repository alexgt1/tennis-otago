Redevelopment of our Home
Plans to redevelop the Logan Park Tennis Centre have been in the pipeline for many years.

Excitingly our redevelopment has gathered much momentum. We are currently negotiating the terms of a new lease with the DCC (the landowner) and will shortly be issuing a prospectus outlining the shape of our redeveloped facility. We are engaged in ongoing talks with contractors and potential funders.

History

In 2016 we obtained funding from NZ Lotteries to complete a feasibility study on Redevelopment of the Logan Park Tennis Centre on the basis of it being able to cater for multiple sports.

We contracted OCTA Project Management to undertake the feasibility study.

The Feasibility Study was ratified at a Tennis Otago Special General Meeting in May 2016.

Feasibility Document revisions were made before it was sent to Lotteries for Approval in June 2016. Click here for the submitted report.

The redevelopment was originally part of the DCC Logan Park Precinct Plan. Unfortunately this plan did not go ahead as no funding was allocated to it in the DCC’s 10 year plan finalised in late 2017.

Since then we have taken forward redevelopment plans ourselves and have made significant progress in 2019.

If you are interested in contributing towards our redevelopment either through your company or personally, we’d love to hear from you.
