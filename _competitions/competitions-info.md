## Court Availability

Want to know if the courts are available for casual entry or a booking? Please email admin@tennisotago.org or call 021 02577898.



## Court Access

The entrance to our Tennis Centre and Courts is at 33 Logan Park Drive, in the upper corner of the carpark where the turnstile is located.

You don’t normally have to book to play at our Tennis Centre, but at times we have other bookings or events, so it’s best to check availability particularly if you have a large group!

To enter the Centre you can either:

Book a certain amount of courts through our management (admin@tennisotago.org).
Put $4 in the Turnstile box and enter through the Turnstile.

## Entry/hire cost

$4 per person per entry (up to half a day).

$8 per person per entry (full day).
